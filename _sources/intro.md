# Welcome to Interactive Oceans Resources Site

This site provides resources for accessing and working with oceanographic data using the Interactive Oceans Data Portal (IO Data Portal) and a series of Jupyter Notebooks. There are also resources for understanding how some of the processing has been done to provide the visualizations within the IO Data Portal.

## What is IO Data Portal

The Interactive Oceans Data Portal is an interface designed to **enable scientists, educators, and students** to quickly **locate** and **plot** cabled, real-time **Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) data** produced by the Regional Cabled Array (RCA).

### Our goals

1. to **increase active use of RCA data** by scientists and to support educators and public exploration of data in the future;
2. to provide **additional tools** for scientists to **discover, access, visualize**, and use RCA data sets suitable for addressing specific science hypotheses;
3. to provide an **intuitive, user-friendly data search and visualization interface**, coupled with a convenient **data downloading** scheme;

### Main Applications
